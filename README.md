- **Class**: CSCI104 (Data Structures and Object Oriented Design)

This is a program that lets the user create a profile, search for movies, and rent movies from a provided list. It uses a graph where each user is a node and calculates the simularities of each user using their ratings they provide for movies and recommends new movies for users using these calculated simularities.
